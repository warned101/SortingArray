# SortingArray

#QuickSort
The quick sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer technique. It sorts the array by taking an element as pivot element from the array.

#BubbleSort
This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm available for sorting. In this algorithm the current element of array is compared with the next element of the array and if the next element is found to be small then it is swapped.

#MergeSort
This is a sorting algorithm and is based on divide and conquer technique. It sorts the array by dividing it in 2 subarrays, sorting them and then combining them again to get the sorted array.
